# pythonSeleniumScraper
This is a website scraper that I made to help out a friend with a larger project.
The main function of the bot is to gain a list of courses from a text document, (which is supposed to be inside the program's directory) log onto his university's website, search for those courses, and compile the information onto an excel sheet that is saved in the program's directory.
The code itself doesn't work since it needs his credentials, but I wanted to use it as an example of a working Selenium bot that I created myself.
